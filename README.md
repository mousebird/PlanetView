# PlanetView
Worldview-like app for mobile (iOS)

This app uses Cocoapods.  If you don't have that on your development machine, you'll need to [go get it](https://cocoapods.org/).

Once you have Cocoapods installed, do a 'pod install' and you should be set up to go.  Just load the Workspace (always the workspace!) and build and run.
